# Usage-Hyper-API with Python

This Program tells you how you can create a Hyper Extract using the Tableau Hyper API
and do lot of stuff directly with the Hyper Extract 
Here in this program i have gone through some of the things that we can do with Hyper API

In this Program,
1. I have created a customer data table and inserted some data to it and created a CustomerData.hyper file which can directly be used by tableau
2. Directly read the data from the CustomerData.hyper extract file that was created 
3. Insert a column to the CustomerData.hype and Update data in it 
4. Delete a record from the CustomerData.hype file
